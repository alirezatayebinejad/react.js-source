1. install node.js from nodejs.org
   node js is javascript runtime which allows us to run javascript commands outside the browser
   installing node js will automaticaly install NPM which we need to install node packages for our project
2. install gitbash git-scm.com/downloads
   gitbash is exacty like cmd (command line) but better looking
3. make sure node and NPM are installed by these commands in cmd or git bash
   npm -v
   node -v
   if you see the version number its alright

note: you can write node command in cmd or gitbash then start writing javascript codes :)
