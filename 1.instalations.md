some pre knowleges:

1. install node.js from nodejs.org
   node js is javascript runtime which allows us to run javascript commands outside the browser
   installing node js will automaticaly install NPM which we need to install node packages for our project
2. install gitbash git-scm.com/downloads
   gitbash is exacty like cmd (command line) but better looking
3. make sure node and NPM are installed by these commands in cmd or git bash
   npm -v
   node -v
   if you see the version number its alright

note: you can write 'node' command in cmd or gitbash then start writing javascript codes :) ctlr+c to end itm

4. add packages with npm
   you should create a package.json file in your project with this command in project folder with command line: npn init or npm init -y (for default)
   to install a package like bootstrap: npm instal bootstrap or npm i bootsrap

install react project:

1. run cmd where ever you want to install the react project
2. run 'npx create-react-app projectName' to create project (in this repository result of this code is in myreactproject folder)
3. run 'cd projectName' to go to the folder which the project is created
4. run 'npm start' to start the project on local server (http://localhost:3000)
