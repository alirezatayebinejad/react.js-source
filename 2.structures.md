1. explaining files and folders in react project:

-   node_modules: contains all the dependencies, modules and packages which the react project doesnt work without them
-   public: hold all assets of out projects like pictures, logo ... by default
-   src: main structures of the website. we work here
    -- reportWebbital: Create React App includes a built-in tool for measuring the real life performance of your app. It is called reportWebVitals and it measures a set of metrics that aim to capture the user experience of a web page.
    -- setupTests.js: test. js is a basic test file.
    -- App.js: here it created a component and export it
    -- index.js: here we imported App component then rendered it to the index.html file which is where it created the webpage
-   .gitignore: is a git file which we say that forexample we ignore node_modules file when we push project to github because it has a big size and also we dont change its content in our project so we dont chase it
-   package.json: contans some information about our project
-   package-lock.json: complete information about project dependencies

2. what you can delete to clean the project:

-   src/setupTests.js
-   src/logo.svg
-   src/index.css
-   src/app.test.js
-   some content of app.js and index.js and all content of app.css
-   all public files exept the index.html file
-   some links and comments in index.html file
-   readme file
